# Changelog

All notable changes to Entieve are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Living NPCs: deterministic patrol around their spawn anchor, threat
  response (proximity, damage, fire/mining near their home, intrusion
  within 8 km), security temperament (high-sec skittish, null-sec
  fight-to-the-death) and a pursuit leash with break-off.
- Sensor visibility: the overview shows system landmarks plus everything
  within a 250 km sensor radius — no more system-wide omniscience. The
  scanner window sweeps for anonymous long-range contacts ("Ship ×3").
- Ammo selection (`CmdSetAmmo`, right-click a weapon slot): preferred charge
  with automatic fallback and a clean reset to auto.
- Warp-to-within (`CmdWarpTo{Range}`, Selected Item 0/10/50 km control).
- Overview scrolling with a draggable scrollbar, sort indicators and
  per-kind filters.
- Movable windows: drag by title bar, click-to-raise, close buttons,
  non-overlapping defaults.
- `entieve describe <id>` content introspection with near-miss suggestions
  (AI-agent tooling).

### Changed

- UI platform decision: chrome migrates to `uikit/` on **ebitenui v0.7.3**
  (pinned), keeping the EVE-dark theme (parity-tested against the legacy
  palette) and the sim command seam. The evaluation spike shipped: resizable
  draggable windows, elastic overview columns with priority shrink and
  name-last ellipsis, sortable headers, visible-only sensor-gated rows.
- Full uikit port: reusable column `Table` (scroll-container + per-row
  containers — solving ebitenui's column/per-row-styling gaps), Overview,
  Selected Item (context-gated actions), Market, Inventory (hold transfers),
  Fitting (stats/resists/slots + fit/unfit/assemble), HUD (layer arcs,
  capacitor, targets), module rack (cycle progress, stat tooltips,
  right-click ammo cycling), BBCode combat log, scanner sweep, starmap,
  help window.
- Warp travel is a process, not a jump: the align gate plus an
  accel → cruise → decel tunnel profile (distance-scaled cruise, minimum
  warp duration, no teleports) — scrams still cancel mid-warp.
- UI typography is ~75% larger and padding +20%, with all chrome metrics
  derived from type and spacing constants (no hand-tuned magic numbers).
- Module tooltips, hover/pressed states, 40 px minimum hit areas,
  right-aligned tabular number columns and soft window shadows.

### Fixed

- The overview no longer reveals every ship, rock and wreck in the system
  from anywhere (EVE-grade sensor tension restored).
- Rats are no longer inert: they patrol, notice intruders and defend their
  belts against miners and shooters.

### Added

- Deterministic simulation core: fixed 60-tick timestep, golden-pinned
  SplitMix64 RNG, minimal deterministic ECS (`core`, `ecs`).
- Data-driven content system: JSON schema for items, ships, modules, NPCs,
  star systems and worlds with full cross-reference validation (`content`).
- EVE-faithful simulation (`sim`): shield/armor/structure with four damage
  types and resists, capacitor recharge curve, turret tracking formula with
  wrecking shots and ammo damage profiles, targeting, warping, mining,
  looting, NPC behavior, station services (repair, market, refine, fitting,
  cargo transfer between holds and the station hangar), stargate travel,
  respawns, clone-bay death respawn (home station across systems), exact
  save/restore with handle reconstruction, state hashing.
- Ebitengine client (`render`, `ui`, `game`): vector ships, starfield,
  brackets, EVE-style overview, ship HUD, module rack, inventory, fitting,
  station services, starmap, combat log, time acceleration (1x-8x).
- Entiverse cluster: three star systems (Solace, Penumbra, Gloam) with
  stations, belts, combat anomalies, stargates, markets and rat spawns.
- Worlds: `world-default` (normal start) and `world-showcase` (test world
  covering every feature).
- Tooling: `entieve run | validate | simulate | version`, tick-scheduled
  command scripts (`script`), headless simulation reports.
- Test suite: unit tests per package, twin-run determinism checks, showcase
  integration suite (`tests`).
- Docs: README, architecture contract, gameplay guide, content-authoring
  cookbook for AI agents.
